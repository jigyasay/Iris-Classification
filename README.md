# Iris Classification
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the classification of the Iris dataset using several machine learning models. 
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, which consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task is to classify these flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is available in the seaborn library. 

It includes the following features:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)

# The project consists of the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries.

Loading the dataset.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Scaling the features.

Training and evaluating multiple classification models.

Visualizing the results.

# Models Used

The following classification models are used in this project:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

# Results

The notebook will output the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for each model. It will also display visualizations of the confusion matrices.
